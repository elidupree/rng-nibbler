# rng-nibbler

"Why do we generate 64 random bits just to produce a random number in 0..3?" That's the question I'm exploring in this repo, where I fiddle around with ideas for generating only as many bits as necessary.

I'm not an expert on PRNGs. The code in this crate is not intended to be high quality, and it's likely that other mathematicians have tried the same things before.
